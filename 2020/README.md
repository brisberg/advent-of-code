# Advent of Code 2020

This is the first year I am attempting [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenge.

This year I have choosen to implement the majority of the puzzles in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Commands

Individual puzzle projects can be executed from the root:

`yarn start <puzzleDir>`
`yarn test <puzzleDir>`

For example, to run the December 2nd puzzle use:

`yarn start 2/`.
