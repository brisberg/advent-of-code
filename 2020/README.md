This is the first year I am attempting [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenge.

This year I have choosen to implement the majority of the puzzles in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with: `yarn install` at the root.

### Commands

Individual puzzle projects can be executed from the root:

`yarn start <num>/<part>`
`yarn test <num>`

For example, to run the December 2nd Puzzle Part A use:

`yarn start 2/A`.
